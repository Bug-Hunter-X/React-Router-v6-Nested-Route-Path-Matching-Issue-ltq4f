This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with nested routes in React Router v6.  The problem arises from path conflicts between parent and child routes, leading to incorrect route matching and unexpected rendering.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a solution using techniques like wildcard paths or more precise path definitions.  This example helps developers understand and avoid this type of routing error.
